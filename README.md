The proposed solution includes an Arduino microcontroller and an MPU-6050 accelerometer / gyroscope sensor. These two devices can be used in tandem to build a motion-controlled computer mouse, a device essential to those who may not have full use of their hands due to physical ailment or disability.

Innovations such as this are indispensable for maintaining a high quality of life in present-times.
